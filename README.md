# **Hangman**

Hangman is a straightforward game that requires a player to guess a specific word that has been randomly selected.The players need to guess letters from the alphabet and have 6 attempts to try and get it right.
Each answer they get wrong leads to the process of the stickman getting hanged and the aim is to stop
this from happening.
